#Daily Send Frequency Suppression DE Automation
If you need to control how many sends each subscriber receives over a period of time to ensure they are not over saturated, you can build an Automated Send Suppression Log to update a list of subscribers who should not be sent more emails during that period.

#Pros:
Automated
Very easy to set up, manage and customise
Ability to overwrite for critical sends

#Cons:
Automation is not real time so multiple simultaneous activities can break through.
One frequency rule for all sends

#Ideal Situations:
Scheduled sends (Single-Email Journeys & Automations that are staggered across the day)
Guided Sends using a Master DE

#Method:
Using an Automation, write a Query Activity that produces a Count(*) of all SubscriberKeys that have over a specified number of rows in the ent.[_Sent] data view in the last 24 hours, and overwrite the results to a “Suppression” Data Extension. Add this DE to the Suppressions for every send, and re-run the automation as frequently as required.
