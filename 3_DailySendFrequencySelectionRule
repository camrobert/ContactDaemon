#Daily Send Frequency Selection Rule
If your sends are not targeting a central or master customer Data Extension - and you are doing some pre-send processing - then you can add some additional send frequency checks into your selection query to exclude over-saturated customers.

#Pros:
Customisable query for each activity; including the ability to count Non-Commercial sends
Query runs at time of selection and is more forgiving of busy send schedules

#Cons:
Can slow down subscriber selection speed in larger accounts
Code needs to be put in every selection query, making it harder to deploy & change.

#Ideal Situations:
Scheduled Sends (Single-Email Journeys & Automations that are staggered across the day)
Guided Sends using custom Sending DEs

#Method:
While building the single-use DE for each send, add the following SQL to the end of the query to check for oversaturation:

  INNER JOIN (
  Select
  SubscriberKey
  ,Count(*) as ‘Count’
  FROM ent.[_sent] 
  WHERE EventDate > DATEADD(day,-1,GETDATE())
  ) s ON s.SubscriberKey = sub.SubscriberKey
  WHERE s.Count < 3

Where “sub” is the table alias for your selected data, and the subscriber must have “less than 3” sends in a 24 hour period.
